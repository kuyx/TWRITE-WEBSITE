        <p>From a modest start in 1964, the Cebu College of Commerce (CCC) of old has come a long way. Beginning with a handful of enrollees, what used to be an undersized college has successfully evolved into a world-class university in Asia Pacific, while holding true to its philanthropic mantra, "NO TUITION FEE INCREASE".</p>
        <p>With forty-two (42) years of quality education, the University of Cebu (UC) has been awarded a Deregulated status by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), while recognized by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) as a learning institution with the most accredited programs.</p>
        <p>Currently, UC is cultivating more than 42,000 promising young minds while producing board topnotchers through its four campuses that are conveniently situated within different parts of Cebu.</p>
